A terminator may be partially responsible for a sustained low coverage level in the Sol operon. Additionally, a promoter motif was located upstream of the CtfA RBS and the pattern of expression is consistent with the beginning of a new transcript. \subref {fig:3b}) A bifunctional terminator, likely responsible for the decrease in coverage observed for both transcripts on their respsective strands\relax }}{22}{figure.caption.9}
