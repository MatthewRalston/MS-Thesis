% This is a section devoted to my previous work on detecting small RNAs

\chapter{Small RNAs}
Small RNAs were discovered in C. acetobutylicum through a combined computational and sequencing screen. Samples were sequenced at different growth stages and under different stress levels, providing a rich experimetnal design for small RNA discovery. A comparative genomics approach was used to identify conserved intergenic regions, that are likely candidates for small RNAs. Many of these candidates had hairpin structures and potential promoter elements. A set of these were homologous to other small RNAs.


\section{Why are we looking for small RNAs?}
Small, noncoding RNAs are a vital component of cellular metabolism and signaling in bacterial cells. Small RNAs regulate gene expression through cis and trans mechanisms. Noncoding RNAs behave as molecular sensors and signal transducers, affecting metabolic behavior and adaptive programs.
